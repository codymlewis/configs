# Here is a small yet pretty detailed example on how to use it:

# [plugins]
# nvim-treesitter = "semver_version"  # e.g. "1.0.0"

# List of non-Neovim rocks.
# This includes things like `toml` or other lua packages.
[rocks]

# List of Neovim plugins to install alongside their versions.
# If the plugin name contains a dot then you must add quotes to the key name!
